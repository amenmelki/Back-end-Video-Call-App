# Back-end-Video-Call-App
This repository contains a demo project for testing and experimenting with a basic video call application.
The code is intended for local use only and serves as a playground for integrating features like video calls, live chat, file sharing, screen sharing, and call recording.
Note: This is not a production-ready application, but a personal project for learning and testing purposes.
